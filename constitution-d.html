    <h2>The Allies' Official Constitution</h2>
    <div class="special" >
      <p>Written by Lxrd Wykea - Edited by A29854 - Revision 23: June 14, 2025</p>
      <p>This document must be read and thoroughly accepted by all members or allies involved in the commanding services piloted by or involved with Padblocker's Allies.</p>
      <p>This constitution represents our regulations for Padblocker's Allies and the like as well as its movements.</p>
      <p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The #RAS (Rebellion Against Scratch) is no longer active.</li>
        <li>Any mention to "me," "I," etc. is referring to Chief Commander Why Kay.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 id="I">Article I - Membership</h3>
      <h4>Participation</h4>
      <p>All users who join Padblocker's Allies will also be added to active affiliate studios to confirm they are active members of our rebellions, revolts, movements, and equality-promotional causes.</p>
      <h4>Movements and Rebellions</h4>
      <p>If a user introduces a revolt or movement idea, the first person to actively advertise or support and/or post, comment, and spread the word about it will be the leader of the movement. If the resultant commander of the movement is not the one to suggest the idea, the idea's creator will serve as second-in-command, or lieutenant commander, of the movement. For instance, I commanded the #RAS and @A29854 will serve as Lieutenant Commander A29854 in the Rebellion, whereas I will be Chief Commander UtkMcpe78. However, this does not change the fact that @A29854 leads The Allied Society and other studios. </p>
      <h4>Titles</h4>
      <p>These are the ranks people in the Allies have. Usually these titles will be restored in any movements, but slight changes may be made depending on who suggested and acted first upon the movement.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b>General</b>: These are the third-highest ranking officers in Padblocker's Allies, beneath Lieutenant Commander and Chief Commander ("Commander" for short). These people will often be lead activists or head announcers for the Alliance.</li>
        <li><b>Colonel</b>: Pronounced `kernel,' a colonel is ranked right beneath the title of General. Colonels will usually command at least one Cardboardian or allied subgroup and/or will often be curators/newly promoted managers of the Allies.</li>
        <li><b>Sergeant</b>: These people are ranked beneath the role of "Colonels," and are usually assistants, right-hand people, or two-way proponents of those in the Colonel ranking.</li>
        <li><b>Private</b>: Lowest ranking of Padblocker's Allies and the associated Army. These people have no authority and are still learning about our studio and how it works. They are not announcers or activists and can be removed if they are not promoted within 30 days prior to being appointed an Ally.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Activity</h4>
      <p>Once joining the Allies or any of its related studios, you agree that in the situation of a war, if you are inactive for 14 or more days without notifying us of your absence, you will be suspended for a week. You also agree that if you are a Colonel or General, your inactivity policy is extended to 30 days. If you must leave for longer, let us know in advance so we can work things out. You can be removed if you do absolutely no activity for 7 to 10 days under certain conditions. If you do not read this THOROUGHLY before joining and you somehow break a policy without knowing it, you will be suspended for a week by me or a General/Colonel of the Allies.</p>
      <h4>Updates to the Constitution</h4>
      <p>I reserve the right to update and create new editions of our constitution without telling you in advance. Once the new version is finished, I will let all of you know, and it is your duty to accept the policies at all times. If you disagree with anything, we will evaluate any possibly unreasonable areas of our constitution. This constitution is supreme over all constitutions of studios and groups under the Allies' authority.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 id="II">Article II - War Codes</h3>
      <h4>Declaring &amp; Handling War</h4>
      <p>If a user is misbehaving, constantly taunting others, or spamming/hacking inappropriately, announcers are required to report to their studios about the activity. If it is suspicious, same code! Links and textual evidence must be presented so that we can verify the validity of the report. We will talk to them and multiple people will explain why it's wrong. Examples of misbehavior include discriminating against neurodivergent people, making derogatory versions of our AYS projects or OCs, or spamming in profile comment threads. If they don't stop after we tell them twice, we will have to go to war. A declaration of war will be issued out as a Scratch project, and all generals must love and favorite the project to make it official. Then, we fight! We expand the Allies' power (if it's still ongoing) onto them, and if Scratch Team stops us, tactics such as ban evasion (use a different email address so you are unidentifiable), using alternate accounts when blocked, and re-sharing ST-deleted projects are rebellious examples of fighting back and are encouraged. ONLY CHIEF CMD. WHY KAY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE WAR! If anybody else, regardless of rank, tries to declare war, THEY WILL BE REMOVED.</p>
      <p>If anybody declares war on us, we must find out as much as we can about why they'd like to battle against us. This is accepted if we also battle against them. Once we accept, it is a requirement and your duty for you to fight with us. If you choose not to participate in our wars, you will be removed. Any unreasonably founded battles will be voided or, if already started - depending on the condition - will also stop. If you are removed from any one studio of the Allies, your participation amongst us will be permanently deprecated. And if you declare war on us because we expel you, we will win. If there is a traitor amongst us, or if there is any war whatsoever, we must all remain strictly loyal and bonded, and stick together during tough times.</p>
      <h4>Loyalty and Battle Operations</h4>
      <p>We often make operations to organize the way we rebel. Operations can include:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b>Mass reporting studios that are against specific Scratchers or Scratch Studios</b>, like if there was an "Anti A29854 Studio" or an "Anti-#RAS Clan." If there are posts that are AYSs about Scratch Team being the one to side with, we will remix with positive information about the Rebellion and our Alliance. Mass reporting is considered wrong and unnecessary, but sometimes we'll have to.</li>
        <li><b>Profile evaluations of our studios'/rebellion's enemies or bitter opponents</b> will often be done by Generals or Colonels so we can find out what our enemies are up to and to stop their plans against our Alliance. Betraying our plans to the enemy is an act of high treason against us. Keep that in mind!</li>
        <li><b>There are more operation types</b>, but we will state them when needed. It is important that you read and accept these rules so that we're all on the same page and that we can be certain you are a true member.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 id="III">Article III - Organization</h3>
      <p>Being part of Padblocker's Allies, we are called "Monarchists." While this may sound egocentric to Scratchers, we are rebels who seek righteousness on Scratch and to stop issues such as mass reporting, ND hate, prejudice against people of specific ethnicities/zodiac signs/sexual orientations, etc. Therefore, it is important you know how our military (or monarchy, for that matter) is organized.</p>
      <h4>Joint Forces</h4>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b>Democratic Malloranist Republic of Kaydenestan</b>. This micronation is a studio created by General Kaydog4512. We are now Allied with that studio! There is, well, territory-like stuff in that studio that we are involved with, so please keep that in mind. Only those who are in Kaydenestan are called "Malloranists."</li>
        <!--<b>Cardboardian Military Army</b>. As the Allies is a self-governed state existing in the CAF (Cardboardia And Frens), and we are very closely associated with Cardboardia, their army is used to help us too. General Mitch leads this army.-->
      </ol>
      <p>People and studios in the Monarchist Army often are the chiefs in handling mass reporting or profile evaluation operations and will handle private chatting functionalities or discussions where suspicious Scratchists will not see.</p>
      <h4>The Diplomacy</h4>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b>Oceanside Republic</b>. A micronation created by Lieu. Cmd A29854 for all sorts of stuff, including Allied business.</li>
        <li><b>Padblocker's Pizza Place</b>. A diplomacy legion created by General Mitch and an outlet of diplomats, to adapt to Cardboardian diplomacy. Can be used for army.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 id="IV">Article IV - Equality and Respect</h3>
      <p>It is, in Allies terms, illegal to discriminate, mistreat, or antagonize anyone on Scratch or in our Alliance on the basis of religious beliefs; race; ethnicity; ethnic origins; mental or physical conditions, wellbeing, or ability; neurotypes; gender; gender identity; sexuality; age; weight; popularity status; and/or other biological or social factors such as height or socioeconomic status. Any form of discrimination will NOT be tolerated in the Alliance and if you exhibit any, you will face consequences depending on the situation and maybe expulsion. It is also important to show empathy for others if they are feeling down or angry, and to help each other grow as people, and at the same time, make sure things go right! Remember, we are trying to FIGHT discrimination, not cause it!</p>
      <p>Glory be to you all, and we greatly thank you, ou friends, for taking time to read and acknowledge this Constitution of the Allies. And if you're scared of getting banned, remember it's about doing what's right and promoting the common good!</p>
      <p>Keep that in mind, and remember that we have faith in all of you. We will win!</p>
      <p>Best work,</p>
      <p><i>Chief Cmd. Why Kay and Lieu Cmd. A29854</i></p>
